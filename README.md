# CellFoundry

**CellFoundry** is a multi-physics, agent-based simulation framework built on FLAMEGPU2 for studying the cellular microenvironment.

The framework integrates interacting cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), fibre networks, diffusing chemical species, and mechanical interactions within a unified, GPU-accelerated model. CellFoundry is designed for in vitro and organoid-scale studies, enabling systematic investigation of how biochemical transport, mechanics, and microstructural organisation jointly regulate cell behaviour.

CellFoundry is modular, extensible, and suitable for large-scale parameter studies, digital twin development, and mechanobiology-driven hypothesis testing.

This is a work in progress with new features added progressively.
